Resolvely.Ai is a Los Angeles based education startup focused on simplifying the college roadmap for prospective highschool students by providing them individualized recommendations, advice, and gamified guidance to lead them through each step of the process. Currently there is an estimated 400+ students for each college counselor, and Resolvely aims to bridge the challenege of providing individualized help to all students - particularly those without the means for expensive options. 

As Resolvely.Ai is still in development, only approved snippets of code can be shared in this repository.
Provided are snippets of SQL, C# .Net, and React.js work that highlight the functionality and views of the website. 

My main set of responsiblities in the Resolvely project consisted of creating the foundational SQL tables for Users and establishing cookie-based authentication and role-based authorization functionality using bCrypt salting and hashing. As a Full-stack developer, I designed the database, data models, API controllers, and React UI views for all parts of the process. This included profile information, such as login information, contact information, avatar selection, and the ability to perpetually change update these records when necessary. Additionally I implemented dynamic tokenized emailing, first-time profile wizards, user dashboards, and account recovery components and backend functionality - all of which contained baked-in validation and sanitization for security, efficiency, to reduce overall load on the application's servers.
